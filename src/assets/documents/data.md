# What Is Digital Abuse?

Digital abuse is when your partner or ex-partner:
- Sends you abusive messages by text, email, phone call and social media
- Sends you explicit and violent images and videos
- Monitors your internet use
- Insists that you give them your passwords to your email or your social media accounts
- Subjects you to image-based sexual abuse by:
    - secretly recording you
    - sharing or threatening to share intimate images of you without their consent
- Blackmailing you into sending intimate images
- Uses technology to track your movements and activities

If any of these examples are familiar to you, you might be experiencing digital abuse:

- You’re being harassed or stalked online or by text or phone call
- Everything you do online is monitored including your social media accounts
- You’ve had personal information or lies shared about you online
- You’ve had personal and private images or video shared online, or been threatened with this
- You’ve had images or videos taken of you without your permission
- You’ve found spyware or GPS tracking software on your digital devices
- You’ve had passwords to your accounts demanded from you
- You’ve had your social media accounts hacked into

## Guidance for Staying Safe Online

### 1. How to Stay Private on Social Media

#### Facebook
To the left of the Post button, you’ll see a box that shows who will be able to see the content. Click the box to choose an audience from a drop-down menu — common options are `Only Me`, `Friends`, and `Public` (anyone on or off Facebook). Change to `Friends` or create a custom list so only people you trust can see your posts. *[Read more](#).* 

#### Instagram
Make your profile private so that followers must be approved before they can see your page. Path: `Profile (bottom right)` → `Menu (top right)` → `Settings` → `Privacy` → `Account Privacy` → enable `Private Account`.

Hide activity status: `Settings` → `Privacy` → `Activity Status` → toggle off.

Review your followers and remove any you don’t recognise or trust. *[Read more](#).* 

#### Snapchat
By default, only friends you’ve added can contact you directly or view your Story. You can adjust privacy:

Path: `Profile` → `Settings` → `Who Can…` then choose who can:
- Contact you
- View your Story
- See your location (turn this OFF for anyone you don’t trust — consider `Ghost Mode`). *[Read more](#).* 

#### TikTok
You can control who can view, Duet, Stitch, comment on, and download your videos; block people; and choose who can message you. *[Read more](#).*

### 2. How to Block Someone on Social Media

#### Facebook & Messenger
Use `Settings` → `Blocking` to add a user. Blocking prevents profile views, friend requests, and interactions. Messenger has a separate block control on the same page.

#### Instagram
Go to the person’s profile → `⋮` (top right) → `Block`. They are not notified. Their likes/comments are removed from your posts.

#### Snapchat
Swipe right to `Friends` → long-press the name → `More` → `Block`. Blocked users can’t see your Stories or contact you.

#### WhatsApp
`More Options` → `Settings` → `Account` → `Privacy` → `Blocked Contacts` → `Add` → select contact.

Alternative paths:
- Open chat → `More Options` → `More` → `Block` → confirm (`Block` or `Report and Block`).
- Open chat → tap contact name → `Block`.

Effects of blocking:
- Messages/calls/status updates from blocked contacts never reach you.
- Your `last seen`, `online`, and profile photo updates are hidden from them.
- Blocking does NOT remove them from your phone’s contacts (delete manually if needed).

### 3. If Images or Videos of You Were Shared Without Consent

**Image-based sexual abuse** occurs when explicit images/videos are shared without consent (including consensually created material later shared non-consensually, or secretly recorded content).

It is a crime in Ireland — you can report it to **An Garda Síochána**.

#### If This Has Happened to You
- Report to Intimate Image Abuse at: `www.hotline.ie`.
- Report the content on the platform (choose the `Report` option; state it was uploaded without consent).
- If you know the uploader, you may request removal directly (only if safe to do so).
- Take screenshots and note URLs for evidence.
- If on a pornography site, use its content removal/report function.

#### Things to Note
- Explicit material likely violates most platforms’ Community Guidelines (e.g. Instagram, Facebook) and may be removed quickly.
- Non-consensual sharing is an offence under the **Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020**.
- If any person depicted is under 18, it constitutes child sexual abuse imagery — report to Gardaí immediately.
- Blackmail/extortion attempts should be reported to Gardaí.
- You have data rights (access, rectification, erasure) under the Data Protection Acts 1988–2003; you can request removal under data protection law.
- For support: **Women’s Aid National Freephone Helpline 1800 341 900 (24/7)** or your local Garda station.

#### If You Receive Unsolicited Explicit Images/Videos
- Report to Gardaí if there is any possibility minors are depicted (possible child abuse imagery).
- Preserve evidence if requested by Gardaí; otherwise delete it.
- Never forward/share such material — doing so may be a criminal offence.

### 4. If You Think You’ve Been Hacked
Unauthorised access can happen through stolen/saved passwords or compromised devices.

#### Signs of a Compromised Account
- Friends receive messages you didn’t send.
- Account details (email, username, password) are changed.
- Login alerts from unfamiliar devices/locations.
- You’re repeatedly logged out.

#### What To Do Immediately
- Record suspicious activity (screenshots/logs).
- Use the platform’s `Help` / `Security` tools to secure the account.
- Sign out of all devices/sessions.
- Review account settings (email, phone, recovery options).
- Reset your password (use a strong, unique one).
- Update or confirm recovery methods/security questions.
- Inform contacts that your account was compromised.

#### Prevent Future Hacks
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA/MFA).
- Use different strong passwords per site (consider a reputable password manager).
- Avoid reuse of old passwords.
- Log out on shared/public devices and clear saved credentials.

### 5. Spyware: What It Is & What To Do
Abusers may use spyware to monitor, control, or intimidate.

#### What Is Spyware?
Software secretly installed to capture activity (websites visited, emails, keystrokes) and transmit it to the installer.

#### Possible Indicators
- Abuser knows private information they couldn’t easily access otherwise.
- Device unusually slow, overheating, or behaving erratically (though spyware can be stealthy).

#### If You Suspect Spyware
- Use a safe device elsewhere (college, library, trusted friend) for sensitive research or communication.
- Avoid searching for “spyware removal” on the monitored device (may alert the abuser).
- Do NOT attempt removal yourself (could destroy evidence useful to authorities).
- Preserve the device if legal action is possible.

### 6. Staying Safe on Email
If someone accesses your email, they can read or intercept communications.

#### Protect Your Email
- Choose a strong, hard-to-guess password; change it periodically.
- Review auto-saved contacts; delete any that could raise suspicion.
- Clean `Sent Items` of messages you don’t want visible (unless needed as evidence).
- Clear incomplete drafts in the `Drafts` folder.
- When replying, remember the original message may remain quoted — delete if necessary.
- Permanently delete items from `Deleted Items` / `Trash` after removal.
- If compromise risk is high, create a new discreet email (neutral username) and keep it secret.
- Save/print threatening or harassing emails — they are evidence (don’t delete).

---

### 7. Keeping Your Phone Private
If usage is monitored, consider discreet safety practices.

#### Practical Steps
- Delete sensitive texts regularly (retain abusive/threatening ones as evidence).
- Check and clear recent calls that may raise suspicion.
- Avoid saving helpline numbers under obvious names — disguise as a friend if stored.
- Block abusive numbers (iOS/Android: open contact → `Block`).

---

### 8. Keeping Internet Usage Private
An abuser may review browsing history or install spyware.

#### Reduce Exposure
- Clear browsing history, cookies, and cache (`Settings` → `Privacy/Security`).
- Remove history for specific sensitive sites if full clearing raises suspicion.
- Use private/incognito mode for sensitive sessions (though this doesn’t hide from spyware or network monitoring).
- Consider using a trusted device elsewhere for high-risk searches.
- *See detailed guides for deleting history per browser here.*

### 9. If You See Someone Being Harassed Online

#### Forms of Online Harassment
- Hurtful/abusive messages
- Posting embarrassing images/videos (without consent)
- Inappropriate tagging
- Spreading rumours
- Threats of harm or violence

#### How to Respond Safely
- Reach out privately: ask if they’re okay and if they want support.
- Report abusive content via platform tools (reporting is typically anonymous).
- If there are threats of violence/self-harm: alert the person targeted and contact Gardaí immediately.
- Help preserve evidence: take screenshots (include timestamps, usernames, URLs if possible).
